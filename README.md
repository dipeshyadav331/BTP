# Supply-Chain-Management


We are building a software which is based on Blockchain and decentralizes the whole supply chain system distributing the information to all parties in supply chain establishing.


## Features

- Effecient
- Transparent
- Secure
- TruthFull Supply Chain in Todays Time


## Deployment

To deploy this project run the following command in frontend directory of project.

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Problems

- Inefficiency to record the origin
- No Full Proof tracing of journey 
- Lack of Transparency , Security



## Solution

By use of Blockchain we are trying to establish Trust , Efficiency , Transparency , Immutability , Smooth flow and High Level Traceability.

We'll use Cryptographic QR's and then place them at local warehouses , which will send the location of user automatically when they're sent , thus imporving the transparency of whole Supply Chain and enabling modern and cashless transaction.

We'll automatically generate transaction id's for next warehouses , thus routing whole of the Supply-Chain and removing the piling up problems .

Also at last , we all know that one of the most awesome features of Blockchain is it's immutability , thus our every transaction will be stored and will be immutable , thus imporving the effeciency of whole supply-chain.
